   2. Signing up for a Pexels account
   3. Copying your API key from the dashboard

   **PostHog Analytics (Optional):**
   PostHog is disabled by default. To enable analytics:
   1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_ENABLED=true`

   4. Optionally customize the host with `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`

   **Sentry Error Monitoring (Optional):**
   Sentry is disabled by default. To enable error monitoring:
   1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENABLED=true`
   2. Create a Sentry account at https://sentry.io/
   3. Create a new project and copy your DSN, org slug, and project slug
   4. Add these values to the 5 Sentry environment variables above

5. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

The project is organized with version-specific components and pages:

- `/versions`: Contains markdown files for each version's changelog.
- `/app/versions`: Contains version-specific pages.
- `/components/editor`: Contains version-specific editor components.

### Version Files and Folders

Each version of the React Video Editor is contained in its own folder under `/components/editor`. For example, version 1.0.0 is located at `/components/editor/version-1.0.0/ReactVideoEditor.tsx`.

To create a new version:

1. Create a new folder under `/components/editor` with the version number.
2. Copy the latest version's `ReactVideoEditor.tsx` file into the new folder.
3. Make your changes and improvements to the new version.
4. Create a new page for the version under `/app/versions`.
5. Add a new markdown file in the `/versions` folder with the changelog for the new version.

## Video Rendering

This project uses [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) for video rendering on AWS Lambda, providing a scalable and efficient solution for processing video edits.

### Remotion Setup

To enable video rendering capabilities:

1. Follow the [Remotion Lambda Setup Guide](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup) to configure your AWS environment
2. Set up your AWS credentials and Lambda function
3. Deploy your Remotion site to AWS S3

For a detailed walkthrough of integrating Remotion with Next.js, check out [this comprehensive guide](https://www.reactvideoeditor.com/blog/video-rendering-with-remotion-and-nextjs).

### Common Issues

Video rendering can be tricky to get right initially. Some common pitfalls to watch out for:

- **Lambda Memory Issues**: The most common problem is insufficient memory allocation. Start with at least 2048MB and adjust based on your video processing needs.
- **Timeout Errors**: Complex renders may require increased Lambda timeout settings.
- **Asset Loading**: Ensure all assets (fonts, images, etc.) are properly uploaded and accessible to Lambda.

Refer to the [Remotion documentation](https://www.remotion.dev/) for detailed troubleshooting guidance and best practices.
